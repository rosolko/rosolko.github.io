    Selenide is a framework for writing easy-to-read and easy-to-maintain automated tests in Java.
    It defines concise fluent API, natural language assertions and does some magic for ajax-based applications to let you focus entirely on the business logic of your tests.

    I started this project as a way if learning <mark>.Net</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged library.
    I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio.
    If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
